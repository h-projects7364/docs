Lists help you organize contacts into groups for targeted outreach, segmentation, and campaigns.

## What Are Lists?

Lists are collections of contacts grouped together for a specific purpose:

- **Campaign targets** – Contacts for a specific outreach campaign
- **Customer segments** – Enterprise vs SMB, by industry, by region
- **Lead stages** – New leads, qualified, nurturing
- **Event attendees** – Conference contacts, webinar signups

2. Find the Lists section
3. Click **Add to List**

## Managing Lists

### Viewing List Members

Click any list to see all contacts in that list. You can:

- Search within the list
- Sort by any column
- Filter by fields

<Frame caption="List detail view showing filtered contacts">
  <video
    autoPlay
    muted
    loop
    playsInline
    className="w-full rounded-lg"
    src="/videos/Viewing-List-Members.mp4"
  />
</Frame>


### Removing Contacts

1. Open the list
2. Select contacts to remove
3. Click **Remove from List**

<Note>
Removing from a list doesn't delete the contact from Pockla—it just removes them from that list.
</Note>

### Bulk Actions

From within a list view, you can perform bulk actions on all or selected contacts:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Export** | Download list as CSV |
| **Add to Board** | Add contacts to a board |
| **Create Link Set** | Generate personalized pages for list contacts |
| **Delete** | Remove contacts from Pockla entirely |

## Using Lists

### For Link Sets

Lists are the primary way to select contacts for personalized pages:

1. Create a Link Set
2. Choose "From a List"
3. Select your list
4. All contacts in the list get personalized pages

{/* TODO: Screenshot - Link Set creation showing list selection */}

See [Running for Contacts](/links/running-for-contacts) for details.

### With Boards

Add entire lists to boards for pipeline management:

1. Open a board
2. Click **Add Contacts**
3. Select a list
4. Contacts appear in the board's first stage

### For Campaigns

Organize your outreach by creating lists per campaign:

- "Spring 2024 Enterprise Campaign"
- "Webinar Follow-ups - March"
- "Trade Show Leads - CES"

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use descriptive names">
    Include the purpose, date, or segment in the name. "Q1 Enterprise Outreach" is better than "List 1".
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Keep lists focused">
    Smaller, targeted lists perform better than large generic ones. Create separate lists for different campaigns or segments.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Clean up old lists">
    Archive or delete lists after campaigns end to keep your workspace organized.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
