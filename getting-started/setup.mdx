### What the Onboarding Agent Does

The onboarding agent is an AI that researches your company in depth. It:

1. **Searches the web** for information about your company
2. **Scrapes key pages** from your website
3. **Synthesizes a company profile** including:
   - Company summary
   - Products & services
   - Target customers
   - Competitors
4. **Crawls your sitemap** to build a page index for link creation
5. **Generates demo contacts** based on your ideal customer profile

This analysis powers features like personalized outreach suggestions and the Research Agent.

<Note>
The analysis typically takes 1-2 minutes. You can navigate away and come back—it continues in the background.
</Note>

### Viewing Your Company Profile

After setup completes, you can view and edit your company profile in **Settings → Company**.

The profile includes:
- Website URL
- Company name
- Short description
- Full analysis (summary, products, customers, competitors)
