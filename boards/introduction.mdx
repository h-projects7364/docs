## What Is a Board?

Each contact in Pockla has their own board. Think of it as a CRM record on steroids:

- **Draggable, resizable panels** arranged in a grid layout
- **Profile information** at a glance
- **Notes** for tracking interactions
- **AI Chat** for asking questions about the contact
- **Enrichment panels** showing AI-generated research
- **Email** integration for viewing and sending messages

Your panel layout is saved automatically—arrange panels however works best for you.

## Accessing a Board

There are several ways to open a contact's board:

1. **From Contacts**: Click a contact row, then click "View Board" from the actions menu
2. **After creating a contact**: When you add a contact from anywhere except the contacts page, you're taken directly to their board
3. **Direct URL**: Navigate to `/board/{contactId}`

## Board Architecture

Under the hood, boards use:

- **react-grid-layout**: For the draggable/resizable grid
- **Per-user layouts**: Your arrangement is saved and synced
- **Per-contact data**: Notes, chat history, and enrichments are stored per contact
- **Real-time updates**: Changes sync across tabs/devices

## Tips & Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Arrange panels for your workflow">
    Put frequently-used panels at the top left. Consider a layout like:
    - **Top row**: Profile (narrow) + AI Chat (wide)
    - **Middle row**: Research panels
    - **Bottom row**: Notes + Emails
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use enrichment panels strategically">
    Create different enrichment panels for different research needs:
    - "Recent News" for keeping up with company updates
    - "Talking Points" for personalized outreach ideas
    - "Competitor Analysis" for sales intelligence
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Take notes after every interaction">
