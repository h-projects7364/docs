The Emails panel in Boards lets you see email history with contacts and draft new messages—all without leaving Pockla.

## How It Works

Email in Boards is powered by the [Gmail Integration](/integrations/gmail/overview). Once connected:

1. **View history** – See all emails exchanged with the contact's company domain
2. **Create drafts** – Write new emails or replies
3. **AI assistance** – Let the Board Agent draft contextual emails for you

<Note>
Emails are created as drafts in your Gmail. You review and send from Gmail—Pockla doesn't send emails directly.
</Note>

Once connected, the Emails panel shows your email history with that contact's company.

## Using the Emails Panel

### Viewing Emails

The panel shows all emails exchanged with the contact's **company domain**. For a contact at `john@acme.com`, you'll see all your emails to/from `@acme.com`.

Each email shows:
- Direction (sent or received)
- Date
- Subject line
- Preview snippet

## Creating Emails with the Board Agent

The Board Agent can draft emails using contact context, company research, and email history.

### Draft a New Email

Ask the agent:

> "Draft an introductory email to John about our analytics platform"

> "Write a follow-up email mentioning our conversation about their Q2 goals"

</Frame>


### Reply to a Thread

Ask the agent to reply to existing conversations:

> "Reply to the latest email thread about pricing"

> "Draft a response to their question about integrations"

### How It Works

1. Agent creates a draft in your Gmail
2. Draft appears in the Emails panel
3. Click to open in Gmail
4. Review, edit if needed, and send

<Tip>
The more data you have on the contact (enrichments, notes, email history), the better the agent's drafts will be.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Check history before reaching out">
    Review the Emails panel before drafting. The agent can reference past conversations, but you should know the context too.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Review AI drafts">
    Always review agent-drafted emails before sending. The AI provides a starting point—add your personal touch.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use for warm outreach">
    Email from Boards works best for contacts you have context on. For cold outreach at scale, use [Link Sets](/links/introduction).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="No emails showing">
    - Ensure the contact has an email address with a company domain
    - Personal emails (gmail.com, outlook.com) won't match company emails
    - Check that Gmail is connected (may need to reconnect if token expired)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can't connect Gmail">
    - Ensure popups aren't blocked
    - Try a different browser
    - Check that you're signing in with the correct Google account
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Drafts not appearing in Gmail">
    - Drafts may take a few seconds to sync
    - Check your Gmail Drafts folder directly
    - Ensure you authorized compose permissions
  </Accordion>
