When you have a defined list of contacts—an outreach campaign, event follow-ups, or account-based marketing list—you run links "for contacts." Pockla generates a personalized page for each contact in one operation.

## When to Use This

- **Campaign outreach** – Email campaigns where each recipient gets a unique landing page
- **Event follow-ups** – Personalized pages for conference attendees
- **ABM lists** – Account-based marketing with tailored content per company
- **Sales sequences** – Personal pages for prospects in your pipeline

## The Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Your Contacts">
    Choose contacts from your Pockla database:
    
    - **From a List** – Select an existing list (e.g., "Q1 Enterprise Prospects")
    - **Select Contacts** – Pick individual contacts from your contacts table
    
    You can select anywhere from 1 to thousands of contacts.

  </div>
</Frame>

    
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Your Page">
    Enter the URL of the page to personalize and use the AI chat to configure elements and prompts.
    
    {/* TODO: Screenshot - Page configuration with AI chat */}
<Frame caption="Screenshot: Page configuration with AI chat">
  <div className="bg-muted/50 rounded-lg p-8 text-center text-muted-foreground text-sm">

    See [Links Overview](/links/introduction) for detailed configuration steps.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Preview with a Sample">
    Before generating for everyone, preview with one contact. Click **Run Example** to see exactly what the AI produces.
    
    {/* TODO: Screenshot - Preview with sample contact showing personalized content */}
<Frame caption="Screenshot: Preview with sample contact showing personalized content">
  <div className="bg-muted/50 rounded-lg p-8 text-center text-muted-foreground text-sm">

  </div>
</Frame>

    
    
    <Tip>
    Try a few different contacts to make sure your prompts work well across various companies and roles.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Run Generation">
    Click **Generate** to create pages for all selected contacts. You'll be taken to the instances view where you can watch progress.
    
    {/* TODO: Screenshot - Generation progress view with status indicators */}

## What Happens During Generation

When you run generation:

1. **Link Set is created** – Your configuration (page, elements, prompts) is saved
2. **Instances are queued** – One instance per contact, all starting in "generating" status
3. **Background processing** – Each contact is processed sequentially:
   - Contact data is loaded (including any enrichments)
   - AI generates personalized content for each element
   - Generated HTML is saved
4. **Progress updates** – The instances table updates in real-time as each completes
5. **Ready for publish** – Once all are generated, you can publish

{/* TODO: GIF - Real-time progress updates in instances table */}
<Frame caption="GIF: Real-time progress updates in instances table">
  <div className="bg-muted/50 rounded-lg p-8 text-center text-muted-foreground text-sm">
    [GIF placeholder]
  </div>
</Frame>


<Note>
Generation happens in the background. You can navigate away and come back—it continues running. Check the progress bar or instances table to see status.
</Note>

## Generation Time

Time depends on:
- Number of contacts
- Number of elements being personalized
- AI response time

**Rough estimates:**
- 10 contacts, 3 elements: ~1-2 minutes
- 100 contacts, 5 elements: ~10-15 minutes
- 500 contacts: ~45-60 minutes

## Using Enrichments

If you've added enrichments to your contacts (via the Enrichment feature), they're available in your prompts.

**Example:** If you have a "Company Summary" enrichment:

```
Write a paragraph explaining how our product solves challenges 
for companies like {{company}}. 

Use this context about them:
{{company_summary}}
```

Enrichments are loaded per-contact during generation, so each page uses that specific contact's enriched data.

## After Generation

Once generation completes:

1. **Review instances** – Check for any failures
2. **Preview pages** – Click any instance to see the generated page
3. **Publish** – Make URLs live so you can share them
4. **Export URLs** – Get a list of all personalized URLs for your outreach tool

  <div className="bg-muted/50 rounded-lg p-8 text-center text-muted-foreground text-sm">
    [Screenshot placeholder]
  </div>
</Frame>


## Handling Failures

If some contacts fail to generate:

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Missing data | Ensure contacts have required fields (company, name) |
| Enrichment missing | Run enrichments before generating |
| AI error | Retry failed instances individually |

Failed instances show an error message. You can retry them without regenerating successful ones.

{/* TODO: Screenshot - Failed instance with error message and retry button */}
<Frame caption="Screenshot: Failed instance with error message and retry button">
  <div className="bg-muted/50 rounded-lg p-8 text-center text-muted-foreground text-sm">
    [Screenshot placeholder]
  </div>
</Frame>


## Publishing

Generated pages aren't live until you publish:

1. Go to your Link Set's instances view
2. Select instances to publish (or "Select All")
3. Click **Publish**
4. Each contact gets a unique URL (e.g., `pages.pockla.io/abc123`)

{/* TODO: Screenshot - Publish flow with URL generation */}
<Frame caption="Screenshot: Publish flow with URL generation">
  <div className="bg-muted/50 rounded-lg p-8 text-center text-muted-foreground text-sm">
    [Screenshot placeholder]
  </div>
</Frame>


Published URLs are immediately accessible. Share them in emails, LinkedIn messages, or any outreach channel.

## Tracking Engagement

After publishing, you can see:

- **Views** – When someone visits their page
- **Time on page** – How long they engaged
- **Clicks** – What they clicked on

{/* TODO: Screenshot - Engagement analytics view */}
<Frame caption="Screenshot: Engagement analytics view">
  <div className="bg-muted/50 rounded-lg p-8 text-center text-muted-foreground text-sm">

  </div>
</Frame>


This data flows back to the contact record and (if connected) to HubSpot.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start small">
    Test with 5-10 contacts first. Review the generated content to refine your prompts before scaling up.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use enrichments for better personalization">
    AI-generated pages are only as good as the data. Run enrichments first to give the AI more context about each contact's company.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Write specific prompts">
    Vague prompts produce generic content. Be specific about tone, length, and what information to include.
    
    **Good:** "Write a 2-sentence headline welcoming {{firstName}} and mentioning a specific challenge {{industry}} companies face with data integration."
    
    **Too vague:** "Write a welcome message."
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Preview different contact types">
    Test with contacts from different industries, company sizes, and roles to ensure your prompts work across your audience.
  </Accordion>
