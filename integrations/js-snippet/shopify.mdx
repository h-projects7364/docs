    {/* TODO: Screenshot of Shopify theme actions menu */}
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Add Your Code

Copy the Pockla script:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.pockla.io/pockla.min.js"></script>
```

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find theme.liquid">
    In the left sidebar, find **theme.liquid** under the **Layout** folder
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Search for <head>">
    Press **CMD+F** (Mac) or **CTRL+F** (Windows) and search for `<head>`
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Paste the script">
    Paste the Pockla script on the line directly after `<head>`
    
    ```html
    <head>
      <script src="https://cdn.pockla.io/pockla.min.js"></script>
      
      <!-- Rest of your head content -->
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save** in the top right
    
    <Warning>
    Be careful not to delete any existing code—even a single bracket can break your theme.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Shopify may display a warning about loading the script synchronously. This is expected—our anti-flicker functionality requires synchronous loading. You can add `async` or `defer`, but this may cause a flash of unpersonalized content.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How big is the Pockla script?">
    Less than 4KB when gzipped—extremely lightweight. It won't significantly impact your store's load time.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Where is the script served from?">
    The script is served via a global CDN, ensuring fast delivery regardless of your customers' location.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Will this affect my store's performance?">
    No. The script is highly optimized. At less than 4KB gzipped, the overhead is negligible.
    
    For additional performance tuning, you can add `defer` or `async` attributes, but this may disable anti-flicker and cause a flash of default content.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is my data safe?">
    Yes. Pockla is designed with security and privacy in mind. The script only loads personalization features you've configured.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I use Google Tag Manager instead?">
    We don't recommend GTM for Pockla. GTM loads scripts with a delay, causing flicker. Install directly in theme.liquid for the best experience.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I remove the script later?">
    Yes. Go back to theme.liquid, delete the Pockla script line, and click Save.
  </Accordion>
