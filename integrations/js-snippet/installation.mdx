## The Script

```html
<script src="https://cdn.pockla.io/pockla.min.js"></script>
```

That's it. One line in your `<head>` section.

## What the Script Does

The Pockla script:

- **Personalizes content** – Dynamically updates page content based on who's viewing
- **Tracks engagement** – Records page views, time on page, and interactions
- **Identifies visitors** – Connects anonymous visits to known contacts
- **Prevents flicker** – Anti-flicker technology ensures smooth personalization

## Script Details

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Size | Less than 4KB gzipped |
| Delivery | Global CDN for fast loading |
| Loading | Synchronous (for anti-flicker) |

<Note>
The script is designed to load synchronously to prevent a "flash of unpersonalized content." If you add `async` or `defer`, the anti-flicker feature will be disabled.
</Note>

## Verifying Installation

After adding the script:

1. Open your website in a browser
2. Open Developer Tools (F12 or right-click → Inspect)
3. Go to the **Network** tab
4. Reload the page
5. Search for "pockla" - you should see the script loading

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Will this slow down my site?">
    No. At less than 4KB gzipped, the script is extremely lightweight. It's served from a global CDN, so visitors download from a server near them.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is my data safe?">
    Yes. Pockla is designed with security and privacy in mind. The script only loads personalization features you've configured and reviewed.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I use Google Tag Manager?">
    We don't recommend GTM for Pockla. GTM loads scripts with a delay, causing flicker (a flash of unpersonalized content). Install directly in your `<head>` for the best experience.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I remove the script later?">
    Yes. Simply delete the script tag from your site and the personalization stops immediately.
