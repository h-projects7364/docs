Adding the Pockla personalization script to your Webflow site's `<head>` section is straightforward. Follow the steps below.

## Step 1: Open Site Settings

In your Webflow Designer, click the **gear icon** in the left sidebar to open **Site Settings**, then select the **Custom Code** tab.

{/* TODO: Screenshot of Webflow site settings */}

## Step 2: Paste the Script

Copy the Pockla script:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.pockla.io/pockla.min.js"></script>
```

In the Custom Code tab, find the **Head code** section (the first input field). Paste the script into the Head code field.

This adds the script before the closing `</head>` tag on all pages of your site.

<Note>
Webflow may suggest adding `async` or `defer` attributes. Our anti-flicker functionality works best with synchronous loading. You can add these attributes if needed, but it may cause a brief flash of unpersonalized content.
</Note>

## Step 3: Save and Publish

  <Step title="Publish">
    Click **Publish** in the top right of the Designer to make the script live
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Custom code changes in Webflow only appear in preview mode until you publish. The Pockla script will not work for visitors until you publish your site.
