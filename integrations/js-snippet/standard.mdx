Adding the Pockla personalization script to your website's `<head>` section takes just a few minutes.

## Step 1: Open Your HTML

Locate the HTML file that contains your site's `<head>` section. This is typically:

- `index.html` for static sites
- A layout or template file for frameworks
- Your theme's header file for CMS platforms

## Step 2: Add the Script

Copy the Pockla script:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.pockla.io/pockla.min.js"></script>
```

Paste it directly after the opening `<head>` tag:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <script src="https://cdn.pockla.io/pockla.min.js"></script>
  
  <!-- Your other head content -->
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Your Site</title>
  ...
</head>
```

<Warning>
Place the script as early as possible in the `<head>` to prevent flicker. Don't add `async` or `defer` attributes—these disable the anti-flicker functionality.
</Warning>

## Step 3: Save and Deploy

Save your changes and deploy to your live site.

## Verify Installation

Open your site in a browser and check that it's working:

1. Open Developer Tools (F12 or right-click → Inspect)
2. Go to the **Network** tab
3. Reload the page
4. Filter by "pockla"
5. You should see `pockla.min.js` loading successfully

## Framework-Specific Notes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Next.js / React">
    For Next.js, add the script to your root layout:
    
    ```jsx
    // app/layout.tsx
    export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
      return (
        <html>
          <head>
            <script src="https://cdn.pockla.io/pockla.min.js" />
          </head>
          <body>{children}</body>
        </html>
      )
    }
    ```
    
    Or use `next/script` with `beforeInteractive` strategy:
    
    ```jsx
    import Script from 'next/script'
    
    <Script 
      src="https://cdn.pockla.io/pockla.min.js" 
      strategy="beforeInteractive" 
    />
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Vue / Nuxt">
    For Nuxt 3, add to `nuxt.config.ts`:
    
    ```typescript
    export default defineNuxtConfig({
      app: {
        head: {
          script: [
            { src: 'https://cdn.pockla.io/pockla.min.js' }
          ]
        }
      }
    })
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Astro">
    Add to your layout's `<head>`:
    
    ```astro
    ---
    // src/layouts/Layout.astro
    ---
    <html>
      <head>
        <script src="https://cdn.pockla.io/pockla.min.js"></script>
      </head>
      <body>
        <slot />
      </body>
    </html>
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Static HTML">
    Simply add the script to every page's `<head>`, or to a shared header include file.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Script not loading">
    - Check for typos in the script URL
    - Ensure there are no JavaScript errors blocking execution
    - Verify the script tag is inside `<head>`, not `<body>`
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Personalization not appearing">
    - Confirm you've published personalization rules in Pockla
    - Check that the visitor matches your targeting criteria
    - Clear your browser cache and reload
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Flash of unpersonalized content">
    - Move the script earlier in the `<head>` (right after the opening tag)
    - Remove any `async` or `defer` attributes
    - Ensure no other scripts are blocking Pockla from loading
  </Accordion>
