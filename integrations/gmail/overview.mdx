## What It Does

Once connected, Gmail integration enables:

- **Email history** – View all emails exchanged with a contact's company domain
- **Create drafts** – Draft new emails or replies directly from Boards
- **AI-assisted emails** – The Board Agent can read your email history and draft contextual replies

## Using the Emails Panel

### Viewing Emails

The Emails panel shows all emails exchanged with the contact's **company domain**. For example, if viewing a contact with email `john@acme.com`, you'll see all emails to/from `@acme.com`.

Each email shows:
- **Direction** – Sent (→) or received (←)
- **Date** – When the email was sent
- **Subject** – Email subject line
- **Preview** – First few lines of content

{/* TODO: Screenshot - Email list with multiple emails */}
<Frame caption="Screenshot: Email list with multiple emails">
  <div className="bg-muted/50 rounded-lg p-8 text-center text-muted-foreground text-sm">

  </div>

Click an email to see the full content.

  </div>
</Frame>


### Email Actions

From the email detail view:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Copy** | Copy email body to clipboard |
| **Open in Gmail** | Open the email in Gmail in a new tab |

### Drafts

Draft emails appear in the list with a pen icon. Click to view and edit in Gmail.

## Board Agent Email Tools

When Gmail is connected, the Board Agent (AI assistant in Boards) can work with your emails:

### Read Emails

Ask the agent to check email history:

> "What's our recent email thread with this contact?"

> "Show me the last few emails with Acme Corp"

{/* TODO: Screenshot - Board Agent reading email history */}
<Frame caption="Screenshot: Board Agent reading email history">
  <div className="bg-muted/50 rounded-lg p-8 text-center text-muted-foreground text-sm">
    [Screenshot placeholder]
  </div>
</Frame>


### Create Drafts

Ask the agent to draft emails:

> "Draft a follow-up email to John about our last conversation"

> "Write a reply to their latest email asking about pricing"

The agent creates drafts in your Gmail—you review and send from Gmail.

{/* TODO: Screenshot - Board Agent creating email draft */}
<Frame caption="Screenshot: Board Agent creating email draft">
  <div className="bg-muted/50 rounded-lg p-8 text-center text-muted-foreground text-sm">
    [Screenshot placeholder]
  </div>
</Frame>


### Reply to Threads

The agent can create threaded replies:

> "Reply to the email about the Q2 proposal"

Replies appear in the correct Gmail thread, preserving conversation context.

<Tip>
The agent uses contact data, enrichments, and email history to write contextual, personalized drafts. The more data you have on a contact, the better the drafts.
</Tip>

## Data & Privacy
