## What is Pockla?

Pockla creates personalized web pages for your CRM contacts at scale. Instead of sending generic outreach, you give each prospect their own branded page—tailored to their company, role, and interests.

**The core workflow:**

1. **Import contacts** from CSV or HubSpot
2. **Create a Link Set** – a collection of personalized pages
3. **Configure your template** – add dynamic fields, your branding, relevant content
4. **Publish** – each contact gets a unique URL to their page
5. **Track engagement** – see who viewed, when, and for how long

## Why Pockla?

| Traditional Outreach | With Pockla |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Same email to everyone | Personalized page per contact |
| "Hi {first_name}" merge fields | Rich, dynamic content tailored to their company |
| No visibility after send | Real-time engagement tracking |
| Manual research per prospect | AI-powered research and enrichment |
