## What Is the Research Agent?

Unlike basic enrichment (which fills in standard fields), the Research Agent:

- Conducts deep web research on contacts and companies
- Synthesizes information into actionable insights
- Provides suggested talking points
- Identifies relevant news and events
- Surfaces connections and commonalities

## Using the Research Agent

The Research Agent lives inside **Boards**. When viewing a contact:

1. Open a board
2. Click on a contact card
3. Use the **Board Agent** chat panel
4. Ask it to research the contact or company
